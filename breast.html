            <h2>Steps to Swimming Breaststroke</h2>
            <p>As the most popular recreational swimming style today, the breaststroke kick is one stroke every swimmer should master. Breaststroke allows you to keep your head out of the water for the majority of your time swimming, and gives you the freedom to swim at slower speeds. This makes breaststroke an ideal swimming method for many people.</p>
            <p>If you want to improve your breaststroke kick, check out our guide below. We’ll explain the history of the breaststroke, steps to mastering the breaststroke, and even give you some breaststroke drills to really improve your stroke. Whether you’re an adult who likes to swim for exercise or a young person just getting started in competitive swimming, now you can learn how to do the breaststroke like an expert swimmer!</p>

            <h2>Kick Movement</h2>
            <p>Lay face-down in the pool. This is what is known as the core position. Extend your arms in front of you and legs behind you. Keep palms down and hands together, with the space between your thumb and index finger forming a V-shape.</p>
            <p>Push off the wall. You’ll get the momentum you need to continue this stroke across the length of the pool. Let your body glide a few paces, then you’ll begin the breaststroke kick.</p>
            <p>Begin the breaststroke kick. From the core position, rotate your ankles outward. Then bring your heels close to your butt and simultaneously bend your ankles toward your shins.</p>
            <p>Extend your legs. From this crunched position, you’ll push your legs outward, extending your knees past the width of your shoulders. Keep ankles angled up and keep your legs straight back. Push ankles downward at the end of the kick.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Arm Movement</h2>
            <p>Add arm movement. Sweep your arms forward without bending at the elbow. Keep palms outward and push your hands out and down. Reach a “Y” position with your body, then bring your hands back toward your mouth. Continue this movement while you kick.</p>
