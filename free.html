            <h2>Steps to Swimming Freestyle</h2>
            <p>Whether you have watched people swimming lanes at the local pool or freestyle Olympic competitions on TV, you have more than likely seen the freestyle stroke, also known as the front crawl. The freestyle stroke maximizes speed and efficiency which is why it is the most preferred stroke of athletes and competitors.</p>
            <p>Learn more about the freestyle stroke, common mistakes often made while attempting this stroke, and techniques you can try to improve your front crawl in the tips below.</p>

            <h2>Kick Movement</h2>
            <p>The freestyle stroke requires your legs to kick up and down in the water with pointed toes which is a simple technique called a flutter kick.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="arm">
            <h2>Arm Movement</h2>
            <p>To execute this stroke, your arms alternate movements from an overhead position moving backward towards the hip, propelling you forward, to coming from the hip and out of the water to the overhead position.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="breathing">
            <h2>Breathing</h2>
            <p>In order to front crawl stroke successfully, you must breathe at the right time during the recovery phase. Inhale the moment your mouth clears the water on your recovery side (side your arm is out of the water reaching forward) and begin to exhale the moment your face turns downward into the water.</p>
            <p>You can use this technique to breathe unilaterally, every other stroke, which means youâ€™re always breathing when the same arm is recovering, or bilaterally which is every third arm stroke. Bilaterally is more balanced and helps you learn to breathe on both sides.</p>
